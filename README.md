# Friends-Data-Cleaning.
Cleaning of Friends Data Set.



## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to perform the following tasks:

Explore the structure and contents of the Friends dataset.

Clean the dataset to handle invalid values and ensure data integrity.

Transform the dataset to prepare it for analysis.

### Dataset
The Friends dataset contains information about the following columns:

`fname`: First name of individuals involved in the movies.

`lname`: Last name of individuals involved in the movies.

`age_sex`: Combined column indicating the age and sex of individuals.

`section`: Section of the movie.

`height(cm)`: Height of individuals in centimeters.

`weight(kg)`: Weight of individuals in kilograms.

`age`: Age of individuals.

`spend_A`, `spend_B`, `spend_C`: Spending data related to the movies.

### Tasks
**Data Exploration**: `df.info()`

Load the IMDb dataset into a Pandas DataFrame: `df = pd.read_csv(r"friends.csv")`

Explore the structure and summary statistics of the dataset.

**Data Cleaning**:

*Handle invalid values*:

Convert invalid values coded as "xx" in the `height(cm)` column to NaN.

Convert invalid values in the `weight(kg)` column to NaN.

Split the `age_sex` column into two separate columns: `age` and `sex`.

**Data Transformation**:

Reorder the column labels as specified.

Perform any additional transformations necessary for further analysis.

**Analysis and Reporting**:

Answer key questions related to movie profitability, languages, genres, producers, directors, and actors based on the cleaned and transformed dataset.

Provide visualizations or summary statistics to support the findings.

**Conclusion**

*This project provides valuable insights into various aspects of movies based on the IMDb dataset analysis. By exploring, cleaning, and analyzing the dataset, we gain a better understanding of movie trends, factors influencing profitability, and key contributors to movie production.*
